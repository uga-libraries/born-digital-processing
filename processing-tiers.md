# Processing Tiers for Digital Archives 

Version 2.1 updated by Emmeline Kaser, Digital Archivist, June 2023 

## Purpose 

This document applies to born-digital collections material in the Hargrett and Russell Libraries. It outlines three tiers of processing — “Standard,” “Enhanced,” and “Intensive” — that progress from the least to the most labor. It also includes descriptions of potential processing needs for each tier so that born-digital collections can be assigned appropriately. This system prioritizes intensive labor for the collections that will benefit most from it, including complex materials and those with higher research value.

The tier assignment is based on the preservation and access needs of the collection materials. It also factors in archivists’ assessment of their research value and desire for a certain granularity of arrangement and description. For hybrid collections, the tier assignment may also be influenced by the processing requirements of the paper materials.  

The digital archivist initially assigns the processing tier after accessioning and technical appraisal. Less-intensive tiers are assigned whenever possible. Once the collecting archivist has appraised the collection’s content and the file inventory is finalized, it may be determined that more intensive processing is necessary and the tier assignment can be changed. 

## Terms and Definitions  

* **Altered access copies:** access copies that are different from the preservation copies stored in ARCHive, e.g. reformatted files or files with redactions 

* **At-risk format:** a file format that may soon become inaccessible, as determined by the National Archive and Record Administration’s Digital Preservation Risk Matrix (NARA Digital Preservation GitHub repository) 

* **Complexity:** a combination of factors including the number of files that require reformatting, the amount of additional research required to access or preserve the formats, the existing level of organization and description, the amount of information requiring manual review, and the amount of information requiring redaction or removal, all of which affect the amount of labor required to prepare the materials for long-term preservation 

* **Research value:** a collection’s anticipated frequency of use as determined by direct interest from researchers, requests for similar materials in the past, its relevance to the library’s core collections, or its relevance to UGA curricula 

* **Sensitivity:** the amount of sensitive information or restricted content in a given collection, as specified by the donor agreement or as identified by the archivist according to organizational policy and/or archival best practice 

* **Sensitive information:** information that should not be made available to the public for legal/confidentiality reasons, because it contains cultural knowledge considered private to a particular community, and/or because it poses a personal or financial risk to an individual (SSNs, credit card numbers, login credentials, bank information, etc.) 

* **Unsupported format:** a file format that is or will soon be impossible to access because it is already obsolete, or because it is obscure enough and/or requires such complex dependencies that the repository cannot properly provide or maintain access to it 

## Tier Descriptions and Assignment Criteria  

### Standard: for materials with low complexity and no sensitivity

_This tier applies to all digital archives material as baseline processing. It indicates little to no additional complexity in the materials._

#### Criteria for collections assigned to standard processing 

* **MUST have a low level of complexity:** no immediate reformatting needs and requires only minimal arrangement 

* **MUST have low sensitivity:** no access restrictions and no issues with PII or sensitive/confidential information 

* **MUST be accessible as-is:** does not require altered access copies  

* **MAY have lower research value** 

#### Processing actions 

* Virus remediation 

* Generate fixity information 

* Generate a format report 

* Technical appraisal 

* Minimal arrangement and high-level description (each AIP given a title and linked file inventory) 

#### Example collection for standard processing:

* <100 files, only a few MB of data 

* All supported formats 

* Descriptive file names 

* Logical folder structure requiring minimal arrangement 

* Collection is currently closed in accordance with donor agreement, but these files will be accessible as-is once the collection is open (no PII risk or need for redactions) 

---
### Enhanced: for materials with low to moderate complexity or sensitivity

_This tier indicates that most or all complexities can be resolved with established and/or automated processes requiring minimal additional research._ 

#### Criteria for collections assigned to enhanced processing 

* **MUST have no more than a moderate level of complexity:** mostly supported and/or low-risk formats, requires some reformatting on established and/or clear migration pathways, requires minimal to moderate arrangement 

* **MUST have no more than a moderate level of sensitivity:** sensitive information can be identified with standard keyword-based PII scanning and only requires automated or minimal manual redaction 

* **MAY have files that require sampling:** manual sampling of files with similar but non-duplicate content, such as photographs 

* **MAY require altered access copies** 

#### Potential processing actions 

* All “Standard” processes (required) 

* Software-assisted PII scanning with review of results 

* Creation of redacted access copies using batch methods or only a few files with manual redaction 

* Some reformatting using established migration pathways 

* Manual file sampling 

* Moderate arrangement 

* Moderate description (each AIP given a title, high-level scope note, and linked file inventory)

#### Example collection for enhanced processing 

* Several thousand files, a few GB of data 

* Likely not sensitive, but the number of personal files justifies a basic PII scan 

* Anticipate that any PII is minimal and can be manually redacted or the file removed 

* Format report shows some high-risk spreadsheets that will be easy to reformat using an established workflow 

* Generally well-organized; folders contents are logically grouped and labeled 

---
### Intensive: for materials with higher research value and/or high complexity or sensitivity 

_This tier indicates a collection that requires special attention due to higher research value, or one with extensive complexities that require manual processes, extensive redaction or reformatting work, and/or additional research to develop a preservation and access plan._ 

#### Criteria for collections assigned to intensive processing 

* MAY have a high level of complexity: large numbers of unsupported formats, formats with unknown or complex migration pathways and access needs, disorganized structure requiring lots of arrangement 

* MAY have a high level of sensitivity: large amounts of restricted or sensitive information to redact, sensitive information with special significance (i.e. serious legal or ethical ramifications), sensitive information that cannot be effectively pattern- or keyword-searched and requires manual review 

* MAY have higher research value: more detailed description desired 

* MAY require altered access copies 

#### Potential processing actions 

* All “Standard” processes (required) 

* Software-assisted PII scanning with additional manual review to look for sensitive information that software might miss 

* Batch or manual creation of redacted access copies 

* Reformatting at-risk or unsupported formats using established migration pathways or researching and developing new pathways 

* Extensive arrangement 

* Detailed description (each AIP given a title, full scope note, and linked file inventory), if higher research value 

#### Example collection for intensive processing 

* Thousands of files, a few GB of data 

* Format report shows hundreds of files created in outdated office software that will require reformatting and potentially additional research 

* Preliminary review reveals what appear to be folders of financial information that will require closer manual review and potentially large amounts of redaction

## Revision History
These tiers were originally created in April 2022.  

This document was revised in November 2022 to better reflect the processing workflows that have emerged since its creation. These revisions remove appraisal from the processing tier criteria with the conclusion that it is unhelpful to try to dictate the “amount” of appraisal in advance. These revisions also remove the itemized list of actions associated with each tier. Now the criteria emphasize manual processes and new research as the most labor-intensive processing tasks, regardless of their exact nature. This means the tiers more accurately reflect a scale of labor, with more flexibility as to which specific actions fall under which tier.  

This document was revised in June 2023 to clarify some of the definitions. The word “risk” was originally used to refer to sensitive content within collections and also the “risk level” of a file format, which are two distinct concepts. In the interest of clarity, the word “sensitivity” is now used to describe sensitive content. Content appraisal was added to the “Unprocessed” column in the results matrix table because we are considering both phases of appraisal to be part of accessioning.

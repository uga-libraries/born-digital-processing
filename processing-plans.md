# Processing Plans for Digital Archives 

Version 1.0 created by Emmeline Kaser, June 2022 

## Purpose 

This document provides standard language describing the three processing tiers for digital archives. After a collection is appraised, it will be assigned a processing tier. A processing plan should then be added to the accession record(s) for the digital material in ArchivesSpace in the “Processing Plan” field.  

This document provides standardized language that outlines the basic processing plan for each tier. Text for the relevant tier can be copied and pasted into the ArchivesSpace accession record to save time. This language should be changed as needed so that it reflects the actual plan for the associated materials. 

### Processing plan language: Standard tier 

This accession is assigned to standard processing. The processing plan includes virus scanning and remediation, generating fixity information, generating a format report, removing trashed and temporary files, and removing exact duplicate material. Materials will be arranged if needed and all changes documented, and a file inventory will be created for each AIP. All relevant preservation documentation, including logs and reports, can be found in the collection folder.  

### Processing plan language: Enhanced tier

This accession is assigned to enhanced processing. The processing plan includes virus scanning and remediation, generating fixity information, generating a format report, removing trashed and temporary files, and removing exact duplicate material. This plan also includes manual file sampling for [CONTENT], software assisted PII scanning with a review of the results, and the creation of altered access copies [DESCRIPTION OF ALTERATIONS]. Materials will be arranged if needed and a final file inventory created prior to creating AIPs. All relevant preservation documentation, including logs and reports, can be found in the collection folder. 

### Processing plan language: Intensive tier

This accession is assigned to enhanced processing. The processing plan includes virus scanning and remediation, generating fixity information, generating a format report, removing trashed and temporary files, and removing exact duplicate material. This plan also includes manual file sampling for [CONTENT], software assisted PII scanning with a review of the results [OR ADDITIONAL MANUAL REVIEW TO LOOK FOR X], migrating at-risk formats, and the creation of altered access copies [DESCRIPTION OF ALTERATIONS]. Materials will be arranged if needed and a final file inventory created prior to creating AIPs. All relevant preservation documentation, including logs and reports, can be found in the collection folder. 

### Technical appraisal
Temporary, trashed, thumbnail, and system-generated files were removed during technical appraisal along with unwanted software files.
